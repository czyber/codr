# Codr
## Description
Codr allows to make simple modifications to a codebase, by providing the repo slug (`owner/repo`) and a task. 

## Scope
Codr is a simple tool that I made to learn about LLM agents and creating and working with vector embeddings.
It is not meant to be a full-fledged tool, but rather a simple proof of concept.
There are many improvements that can be made, from code quality to features. I plan on extending this tool in the future.
