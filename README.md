# Codr
## Description
Codr allows to make simple modifications to a codebase, by providing the repo (`owner/repo`) and a task.

## Scope
Codr is a simple tool that I made to learn about different technologies and concepts.
You might find aspects that are over-engineered or under-engineered, that is because I wanted to experiment with different things and focus on learning rather than on the final product.

It is not meant to be a full-fledged tool, but rather a simple proof of concept.
There are many improvements that can be made, from code quality to features. I plan on extending this tool in the future.
